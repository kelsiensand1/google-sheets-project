Pitch

Mose Seidi was busy tending to customers over the weekend. He manages EP Deli Grocery, a bodega on 469 Brook Ave. Two years ago, this bodega participated in the healthy livable program, a campaign comprised of multiple nonprofits that encouraged Bronx community members to eat healthy by partnering with bodegas.
